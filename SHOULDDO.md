Current Bugs
================
- [x] When you collapse the screen the menu becomes an 'x' instead of the triple bars. After clicking twice it becomes the triple bars. This is due to the fact that the collapsed class is not getting attached to the class after the screen is collapsed.
- [ ] Remove the animate.css file and replace it with only the animations you are using from the file. Do once you have all animations finished.
- [ ] Only load the css needed by the select page? Or would it be better to just let it all load at once and have it cached?
- [ ] Update crossBroswer.less so it contains all the browser prefixes not just some of them
- [ ] Go through and make CSS as efficient as possible while still being easy to change
- [ ] Go through CSS at end and have one main file which has the css used by more than one page
- [ ] Get rid of 'image-row' class on features page and use col-md instead?
- [ ] Compress images for the web (Photoshop) such as those icons on the first page etc.
- [ ] Don't use 'move-up' class for the button on pricing and TnC page
- [ ] Find a better way of adding the correct javascript files to the page instead of control flow?
- [ ] Rename landing page class to something better
- [ ] Changes transitions from all to only where needed
- [ ] For filenames use only '_' or '-' but not both. Specify which one in the guide
- [ ] Fix the top header issue (ie. figure out a better way then `header` classes)
- [ ] Use bootstrap on the footer columns
- [ ] Have webkit font-smoothing on the body?
- [ ] Have colors stated at top
- [ ] Add markup to blog for ease of use
- [ ] Wrap each page in it's own div if you haven't done so already
- [ ] Have underline on the current page
- [ ] Have a global css page imported first and a general one that is import last to reset styles (so you won't have to use !important)
- [ ] Would automatically search blog images folder on blog pages
- [x] Can you do a double layout for the blog (ie. reuse the original layout) [Not possible with EJS - had to simplify layout as much as possible]
