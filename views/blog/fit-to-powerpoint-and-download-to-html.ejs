<h2>Fit and Download for PowerPoint and Keynote</h2>
<br>
<p>Product managers are challenged by balancing content and design on their roadmap slides. It becomes especially difficult when content needs to be modified and the design needs reformatting. Roadmunk's "Fit to PowerPoint" solves this problem.</p>

<p>PowerPoint and Keynote slides typically have the dimensions of 4:3 or 16:9. Quite often, depending on the projector or monitor being used, there are corresponding resolutions that work best. For example, if you dimensions (ie. aspect ratio) of 4:3, the most common resolutions (as found <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution">here</a>), are 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1280 x 1024. </p>
<br>
<p>To try this feature out, first click on the <b>export</b> icon in the top right of the Timeline View.</p>

<br>
<p>Make sure <b>format</b> is set to PNG. </p>

<p>From here, we recommend leaving orientation landscape, setting the dimensions to <b>4:3</b>, and the resolution at <b>1024 x 768</b>. This is the most common use case; however, feel free to try different variations. Regardless of content density, we aim to balance the sizing of elements so that your design will appeal to the audience. </p>
