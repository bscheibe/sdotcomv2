<h2>Color Items</h2>
<p>Design is at the center of Roadmunk and we want to create the greatest visual experience for our users. Therefore, weâ€™ve introduced the capability to color items using three beautifully designed palettes. Simply select a field to Color by (eg. status), and assign the different values to a color to create the perfect roadmap.</p>
